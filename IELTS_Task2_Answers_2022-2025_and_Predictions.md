1) Dec 27, 2022 â€” Some people think that social networking sites have a huge negative impact on both individuals and society. To what extent do you agree or disagree? (Opinion essay)

Social networking platforms have transformed how people communicate, work and access information. While some argue they have a severely negative impact on individuals and society, I believe the picture is mixed; social media brings real benefits, yet unregulated or excessive use can be damaging. On balance, I partly agree with the concerns and advocate for measured, responsible use supported by better policy and education.

On the positive side, social networks connect friends and families across borders, facilitate professional networking, and amplify marginalized voices. During emergencies and social movements, they can disseminate critical information rapidly. Small businesses also leverage targeted advertising and direct engagement to compete with larger firms, which can promote economic inclusivity.

However, serious drawbacks exist. At the individual level, algorithm-driven feeds may encourage compulsive scrolling, leading to reduced attention spans, sleep problems, and anxiety. The pressure to present a flawless life can harm self-esteem, particularly among adolescents. At a societal level, echo chambers and misinformation can polarize communities and undermine trust in institutions. Moreover, data privacy violations and manipulationâ€”such as micro-targeted political contentâ€”raise ethical questions about autonomy and informed consent.

In my view, the issue is not the technology itself but the incentives and habits surrounding it. Governments should require greater transparency from platforms about algorithms and data usage, while schools should deliver media literacy so users can critically assess sources and set healthy boundaries. On an individual level, turning off non-essential notifications, curating follows, and setting time limits substantially reduce harms.

In conclusion, social networking sites can harm both individuals and society when poorly regulated and consumed without intention. Yet, with robust safeguards and informed use, their benefitsâ€”connection, opportunity, and information sharingâ€”can be realized without the worst adverse effects. I therefore partially agree with the statement but see a clear path to mitigation.

2) Dec 25, 2022 â€” Online currencies have become more common in recent years. Why is this? Is this a positive or negative development? (Cause & effect + opinion)

Digital currencies, including cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), have grown rapidly in recent years. Several forces explain this rise, and the overall implications are mixed, though I believe the development is broadly positive if accompanied by sound regulation.

The first driver is technological progress. Distributed ledger systems enable near-instant, borderless transactions with transparent records. This appeals to globalized commerce and remittances, where traditional cross-border payments can be slow and expensive. Second, financial inclusion motivates adoption; digital wallets can reach unbanked populations via smartphones, allowing participation in commerce and savings. Third, investors are attracted by innovation and potential returns, which fuels demand and ecosystem development. Finally, the pandemic accelerated digitalization, normalizing cashless transactions and e-commerce.

However, the trend poses challenges. Price volatility in many cryptocurrencies undermines their function as a stable medium of exchange. Illicit use is a risk, although blockchain analytics have also improved enforcement. Energy consumption, particularly in proof-of-work systems, raises environmental concerns, though newer consensus mechanisms are more efficient. Consumer protection is another issue: inexperienced users can lose funds to scams, hacks, or poorly governed exchanges.

Despite these drawbacks, I consider the shift largely positive if authorities implement balanced rules. Regulations should focus on anti-money laundering, consumer protection, stablecoin reserves, and exchange oversight without stifling innovation. Encouraging CBDC pilots and interoperable standards could deliver efficiency and trust. Education campaigns would also reduce user risk.

In conclusion, online currencies have expanded due to technological capability, financial inclusion goals, investor interest, and broader digitization. The development can be beneficialâ€”lower costs, faster payments, and broader accessâ€”provided that governments and industry prioritize stability, transparency, and user protection.

3) Dec 24, 2022 â€” Some people think that it is good for a countryâ€™s culture to import foreign movies and TV programmes. Others think that it is better to produce these locally. (Discussion essay)

Cultural industries are central to national identity and economic development. Some argue that importing foreign films and programmes enriches a countryâ€™s culture, whereas others believe local production should be prioritized. Both views have merit; in my opinion, the optimal approach balances exposure to global content with robust support for domestic creators.

Proponents of foreign media stress its educational and artistic value. High-quality international productions expose audiences to diverse narratives, techniques, and perspectives, broadening horizons. This cross-pollination can inspire local filmmakers to innovate and raise standards. Moreover, importing content can be cost-effective in small markets that cannot fund a full pipeline of genres and formats.

Conversely, advocates for local production highlight culture preservation and industry growth. Homegrown stories resonate more deeply, reflecting local languages, humor, and social realities. Investing in domestic creators builds jobs across the value chainâ€”writing, production, post-productionâ€”and can develop export potential, as seen in the global success of Korean and Turkish dramas. Over-reliance on imports risks cultural homogenization and weakens national soft power.

I believe countries should pursue a dual strategy. Reasonable quotas or funding incentives can ensure a minimum level of local content on major platforms, while co-production treaties and training grants help domestic teams acquire skills. Simultaneously, audiences should enjoy access to foreign works through fair licensing and subtitling, enabling learning and enjoyment. Public broadcasters can play a vital role by commissioning local content that commercial markets might overlook, such as minority-language programming.

In conclusion, importing foreign media enriches cultural diversity, but sustained investment in domestic production is essential for cultural vitality and economic resilience. A balanced policyâ€”access plus capacity-buildingâ€”best serves both audience interests and national cultural development.

4) Dec 21, 2022 â€” As the number of cars increases, more money has to be spent on road systems. Some people think the government should pay for this. Others, however, think that drivers should cover the costs. Discuss both views and give your opinion. (Discussion essay)

As car ownership rises, governments face mounting expenses to expand and maintain road infrastructure. Some argue that these costs should be borne by the state, while others believe drivers should pay. Both positions have logic; I contend a mixed funding model is fairest and most efficient.

Those supporting government funding emphasize roads as public goods that underpin economic activity and social mobility. Tax-funded infrastructure ensures universal access, including for emergency services and public transport. National planning allows integrated networks that would be challenging to finance piecemeal. Furthermore, state financing can smooth out regional disparities; areas with fewer drivers still require safe roads.

Advocates of driver funding focus on fairness and incentives. Since motorists directly use and wear roads, fuel taxes, tolls, and vehicle levies follow the user-pays principle. Pricing can also manage congestion and pollution: higher charges at peak times encourage carpooling or public transport. This approach internalizes externalitiesâ€”noise, emissions, accidentsâ€”helping align private choices with social costs.

In my view, a hybrid model works best. Baseline road networks, especially in rural and low-income regions, should be funded primarily from general taxation to guarantee equity. Urban expressways and congestion-prone corridors can adopt variable tolling and parking charges to regulate demand and finance upkeep. As fleets electrify, fuel taxes will erode; therefore, distance-based road pricing and weight-class fees should gradually replace them. To maintain public support, revenues must be transparently earmarked for transport improvements, including safer cycling lanes and better public transit.

In sum, roads serve the entire economy, but drivers impose specific costs. Combining general taxation with smart user fees delivers fairness, efficiency, and environmental benefits.

5) Dec 12, 2022 â€” Many people today argue that cinemas are becoming irrelevant due to new streaming services. To what extent do you agree or disagree? (Opinion essay)

The proliferation of streaming services has led many to claim that cinemas are losing relevance. Although on-demand platforms have reshaped viewing habits, I disagree that theatres are obsolete. Cinemas retain distinct social, technical, and cultural value that complementsâ€”not competes withâ€”home streaming.

First, the cinema experience is inherently social and immersive. Large screens, calibrated sound, and a distraction-free environment foster shared emotional responses that living rooms rarely replicate. This is particularly true for spectacle-driven genresâ€”epics, science fiction, and animationâ€”whose visual and auditory details are designed for theatrical presentation. For filmmakers, this venue remains the canvas for artistic intent.

Second, cinemas act as cultural hubs. Festivals, Q&A sessions with directors, and curated retrospectives promote film literacy and community engagement. Independent theatres often champion diverse voices, giving screen time to foreign-language and art-house films that algorithms may bury. Such programming enriches local cultural life.

That said, streaming offers undeniable convenience, affordability, and breadth of choice. It democratizes access for those far from theatres or with mobility constraints. Studios now favor hybrid releases, and some mid-budget films are premiering online. Yet even in this landscape, cinema attendance rebounds for event films and awards contenders, suggesting persistent demand for premium experiences.

The future, therefore, is coexistence. Cinemas can innovate through dynamic pricing, premium formats, and partnerships with streamers for limited theatrical windows. Meanwhile, streaming can focus on series and niche content where bingeable formats excel. Policy supportâ€”such as tax incentives for local cinemasâ€”can preserve cultural infrastructure.

In conclusion, streaming has transformed consumption but has not erased the unique value of cinemas. Theatrical exhibition will remain relevant by evolving and emphasizing experiences that home viewing cannot easily match.

6) Dec 11, 2022 â€” Some people say that to prevent illness and disease, governments should focus more on reducing environmental pollution and housing problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree? (Opinion essay)

Public health is shaped by social and environmental determinants. The view that governments should prioritize reducing pollution and addressing housing problems to prevent disease is, in my opinion, well-founded. While clinical services remain crucial, prevention requires structural interventions.

Air and water pollution are linked to respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular disease, and cancers. Tightening emissions standards, transitioning to clean energy, and improving waste management can substantially lower disease burdens. For example, cities that replaced diesel buses with electric fleets recorded fewer asthma-related hospital visits. Likewise, water treatment and industrial regulation reduce gastrointestinal and neurological disorders.

Housing conditions are equally significant. Overcrowding accelerates infectious disease spread, and damp, poorly insulated homes contribute to mold-related respiratory issues. Energy-inefficient buildings exacerbate fuel poverty, forcing families to choose between heating and nutritionâ€”choices that undermine health. Investing in affordable, well-insulated housing and enforcing building codes can prevent these harms at scale.

Critics argue that such policies are costly and slow to implement. However, the long-term savings from reduced healthcare expenditure and increased productivity are substantial. Cost-benefit analyses repeatedly show high returns on preventionâ€”fewer sick days, better educational outcomes for children, and healthier aging. In addition, targeted subsidies and public-private partnerships can spread costs and accelerate upgrades.

To be clear, prevention should not replace primary care or vaccination programs; it should complement them. A comprehensive strategy includes environmental regulation, urban planning for active transport, and housing retrofits, alongside health education and accessible clinics.

In conclusion, prioritizing pollution reduction and housing improvements is a prudent, evidence-based path to disease prevention. Governments that invest in these determinants create healthier populations and more sustainable economies.

7) Dec 10, 2022 â€” Some employers are giving more value on hiring people with good social skills apart from good qualifications. Do you agree or disagree that social skills are just as crucial as good qualifications for success at work? (Opinion essay)

In contemporary workplaces, employers increasingly value interpersonal abilities in addition to formal qualifications. I agree that social skills are as crucial as credentials for long-term success. While technical knowledge opens doors, people skills often determine how far one advances.

Firstly, modern work is collaborative. Teams must coordinate across functions, cultures, and time zones. Employees who can listen actively, resolve conflicts, and build trust accelerate projects and foster innovation. For instance, a highly qualified engineer who communicates poorly can derail a product launch, whereas a competent communicator can align stakeholders and overcome obstacles.

Secondly, clients and partners expect empathetic, responsive service. Negotiation, persuasion, and relationship management are core to sales, consulting, and even technical roles that require stakeholder buy-in. In leadership, emotional intelligenceâ€”recognizing and managing oneâ€™s own emotions and those of othersâ€”correlates strongly with performance metrics such as retention and engagement.

That said, qualifications remain essential. They signal foundational knowledge, adherence to professional standards, and the ability to handle complex tasks safelyâ€”critical in fields like medicine, law, and engineering. The ideal employee marries robust domain expertise with effective communication, adaptability, and cultural competence.

Therefore, hiring and training should reflect a balanced model. Organizations can assess social skills through behavioral interviews, group tasks, and references, while offering ongoing developmentâ€”coaching, feedback culture, and mentorshipâ€”to nurture these capabilities. Educational institutions should embed teamwork, presentations, and real-world projects alongside technical modules.

In conclusion, social skills are not a â€œnice-to-haveâ€ but a co-equal pillar of workplace success. Combining qualifications with strong interpersonal abilities produces resilient, high-performing professionals who add value beyond their job descriptions.

8) Dec 7, 2022 â€” Some people believe that children of all ages should have extra responsibilities (for example, helping at home or at work). Others believe that, outside of school, children should be free to enjoy their lives. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. (Discussion essay)

Whether children should take on extra responsibilities outside school or be free to enjoy their time is a perennial debate. Both perspectives prioritize childrenâ€™s well-being but differ in their approach. I believe age-appropriate responsibilities are beneficial if balanced with ample leisure.

Supporters of additional responsibilities argue these tasks cultivate independence and life skills. Helping at homeâ€”doing laundry, cooking simple meals, or caring for petsâ€”teaches accountability, time management, and cooperation. Early exposure to responsibility can build self-efficacy, making transitions to adolescence and adulthood smoother. Moreover, contributing to family duties fosters empathy and a sense of belonging.

Opponents worry that responsibilities can become burdensome, undermining childhood as a period of exploration and play. Excessive chores or part-time work may increase stress, reduce study time, and limit socialization, potentially harming development. Children also need unstructured play to boost creativity and emotional regulation; overscheduling risks burnout.

In my view, the key is proportionality and choice. Short, predictable chores matched to the childâ€™s ageâ€”setting the table, tidying roomsâ€”can be integrated into routines without overwhelming them. Parents should solicit childrenâ€™s preferences and rotate tasks to build varied skills. Crucially, responsibilities must not substitute for adult obligations in struggling households; social services should step in where necessary.

Schools can reinforce this balance by incorporating project-based learning and service activities that teach responsibility in supportive environments. At the same time, protecting evenings or weekends for sports, arts, and rest preserves the joys of childhood.

In conclusion, responsibilities and free time are not mutually exclusive. Carefully calibrated duties can empower children while safeguarding space for play, friendships, and discovery.

9) Dec 2, 2022 â€” In recent years, there has been growing interest in the relationship between equality and personal achievement. Some people believe that individuals can achieve more in egalitarian societies. Others believe that high levels of personal achievement are possible only if individuals are free to succeed or fail according to their individual merits. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion. (Discussion essay)

The relationship between equality and individual achievement is complex. Some argue that egalitarian societies enable greater accomplishments, while others contend that freedom to succeed or fail drives excellence. I believe high levels of personal achievement emerge most reliably where equality of opportunity coexists with merit-based rewards.

Egalitarian systems reduce barriers that waste talent. When education, healthcare, and basic security are accessible, more people can reach their potential. For example, subsidized higher education expands the pool of innovators, as seen in countries with strong social safety nets and robust research output. Additionally, social cohesion reduces chronic stress, which improves cognitive performance and productivity.

Conversely, systems that emphasize pure meritocracy without guardrails can unleash intense competition that motivates some to excel. High rewards for success can attract risk-taking entrepreneurs and top-tier professionals. However, without baseline equality, those advantages often compound among the already privileged, limiting genuine competition. Talent from disadvantaged backgrounds may never enter the race, resulting in suboptimal societal outcomes.

Furthermore, the best-performing economies often combine inclusive foundations with competitive markets: scholarships and loan support widen access, while transparent promotion criteria and high standards keep incentives sharp. In practical terms, that mix produces both a broad base of contributors and recognizable role models who stretch the frontier of performance.

The optimal arrangement, therefore, combines both. Guaranteeing universal access to early childhood education, fair admissions, and portable healthcare creates a level starting line. Performance-based incentives, transparent promotion criteria, and support for high achievers preserve dynamism. A progressive tax system can fund opportunity-enhancing services while still rewarding exceptional contributions.

In conclusion, equality and achievement need not be in tension. Societies that align equality of opportunity with meritocratic incentives typically see broader participation in excellence and sustainable growth.

10) Nov 30, 2022 â€” Doing an enjoyable activity with a child is better for their overall skills development and creativity than reading. To what extent do you agree? (Opinion essay)

Some claim that engaging in enjoyable activities with children is better for overall development and creativity than reading. I disagree with this strict comparison. Both play and reading are essential and mutually reinforcing; the best outcomes arise when they are integrated.

Play-based activities develop fine and gross motor skills, problem-solving, and social competence. Building with blocks, role-playing, or outdoor games stimulate imagination and collaboration. These experiences provide concrete contexts for language, making future reading more meaningful. Moreover, shared activities strengthen emotional bonds, which are foundational for learning.

Reading, however, confers unique advantages. It exposes children to rich vocabulary, complex sentence structures, and abstract ideas, laying the groundwork for academic success. Storybooks cultivate empathy by allowing children to inhabit diverse perspectives. Regular reading routines also build attention span and self-regulationâ€”skills transferable to other domains.

Equally important, reading ignites creativity by encouraging children to visualize scenes, characters, and outcomes that are not immediately present. This act of mental simulation is a powerful engine for imagination and later creative writing. When parents connect stories to hands-on projectsâ€”drawing a scene, building a model from a book, cooking a recipe mentioned in a storyâ€”children deepen comprehension and see literacy as a springboard for making and doing.

In summary, enjoyable activities and reading are not competitors but complementary pillars of development. Prioritizing one exclusively would be a mistake; integrating both supports creativity, language, and socio-emotional growth.


Furthermore, practical implementation should be guided by clear metrics, reasonable timelines, and regular public reporting. Schools, employers, and local authorities can pilot small-scale initiatives, gather feedback, and iterate rather than attempting one-size-fits-all reforms. By pairing policy with education, investing in capacity, and tracking outcomes, stakeholders can adapt quickly, scale what works, and ensure that benefits are distributed fairly across communities. This pragmatic, evidence-led approach reduces unintended consequences, strengthens public trust, and makes the overall strategy more resilient to economic shocks and social change.
11) Nov 25, 2022 â€” Learning at university would be more effective if men and women were educated separately. To what extent do you agree or disagree? (Opinion essay)

The suggestion that university learning would be more effective if men and women studied separately remains contentious. I largely disagree; mixed-gender education better prepares students for real-world environments and enhances academic richness, provided institutions address specific equity issues.

Co-educational settings mirror professional contexts where diverse teams collaborate. Learning to communicate across genders develops interpersonal skills valuable in workplaces. In seminars, mixed perspectives yield deeper analysis, particularly in disciplines where gendered experiences shape understandingâ€”health, law, or sociology.

Advocates of separation argue that single-gender environments reduce distractions and stereotype threat, enabling studentsâ€”especially women in STEMâ€”to participate more freely. There is evidence that female-only cohorts can increase confidence in male-dominated subjects. However, these benefits can be achieved within co-ed institutions through targeted measures: inclusive pedagogy, mentorship programs, and policies addressing harassment.

Moreover, segregation risks reinforcing stereotypes and limiting networking opportunities. It may also hinder institutional accountability by isolating problems rather than confronting them. Universities should focus on campus safety, equitable participation, and flexible assessment rather than structural separation.

Additionally, where single-gender options exist, they should complementâ€”not replaceâ€”mainstream provision, serving specific needs such as trauma-informed spaces or religious accommodation while maintaining pathways for collaboration across cohorts. This preserves choice without normalizing division.

In conclusion, while single-gender options can be valuable in certain contexts, co-education generally delivers more authentic preparation for diverse societies and economies. The priority should be inclusive practices that allow all students to thrive together.


Furthermore, practical implementation should be guided by clear metrics, reasonable timelines, and regular public reporting. Schools, employers, and local authorities can pilot small-scale initiatives, gather feedback, and iterate rather than attempting one-size-fits-all reforms. By pairing policy with education, investing in capacity, and tracking outcomes, stakeholders can adapt quickly, scale what works, and ensure that benefits are distributed fairly across communities. This pragmatic, evidence-led approach reduces unintended consequences, strengthens public trust, and makes the overall strategy more resilient to economic shocks and social change.
12) Nov 16, 2022 â€” Some people believe more actions can be taken to prevent crime, while others think that little can be done. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion. (Discussion essay)

Opinions diverge on whether additional measures can meaningfully prevent crime or whether society has reached a limit. I believe there remains substantial scope for prevention, particularly by addressing root causes and leveraging technology ethically.

Proponents of the â€œlittle can be doneâ€ view note that crime is persistent and partly driven by human nature. They argue that incremental policy changes yield diminishing returns and that excessive policing can erode civil liberties. Moreover, some crime types migrate rather than disappear, as with cybercrime.

However, evidence supports prevention through social investment. Early childhood programs, quality education, and vocational pathways reduce youth offending by enhancing future prospects. Urban designâ€”improved lighting, active street fronts, and mixed-use planningâ€”can deter opportunistic crime. Focused deterrence strategies that engage high-risk groups and offer support while clearly communicating consequences have lowered violence in multiple cities.

Technology can assist when used responsibly: data-informed deployment, body-worn cameras, and community reporting apps increase accountability and responsiveness. At the same time, safeguards against bias and overreach are essential. Rehabilitation programs, mental health services, and substance abuse treatment reduce recidivism sustainably.

Furthermore, community trust is pivotal. Initiatives co-designed with residentsâ€”violence interruption, restorative circles, and youth mentorshipâ€”create local legitimacy that top-down enforcement often lacks. When people feel heard, they are more likely to cooperate with authorities, report crimes, and support witness testimony, all of which deter repeat offending.

In sum, crime is not immutable. By targeting risk factors, improving environments, and strengthening trust between communities and justice systems, societies can meaningfully prevent crime without sacrificing rights.


Furthermore, practical implementation should be guided by clear metrics, reasonable timelines, and regular public reporting. Schools, employers, and local authorities can pilot small-scale initiatives, gather feedback, and iterate rather than attempting one-size-fits-all reforms. By pairing policy with education, investing in capacity, and tracking outcomes, stakeholders can adapt quickly, scale what works, and ensure that benefits are distributed fairly across communities. This pragmatic, evidence-led approach reduces unintended consequences, strengthens public trust, and makes the overall strategy more resilient to economic shocks and social change.
13) Nov 11, 2022 â€” Some argue that patriotism is the primary cause of wars globally. Others feel that it serves to prevent less ethical politicians from running a country and starting wars. Discuss both views and give your opinion. (Discussion essay)

Some claim patriotism fuels war, while others argue it protects nations from unethical leaders and conflicts. In reality, patriotism is a double-edged sword: it can be exploited to justify aggression, yet it can also mobilize citizens to resist tyranny and uphold international law.

On the negative side, extreme nationalism can dehumanize outsiders and stifle dissent. Leaders have historically used patriotic rhetoric to rally support for expansionist aims or to distract from domestic failures. When patriotism becomes unquestioning loyalty, it enables manipulation and suppresses critical debate that could prevent conflict.

Conversely, principled patriotismâ€”love of country aligned with democratic valuesâ€”can be a force for peace. It empowers citizens to hold leaders accountable, protest unjust wars, and support diplomacy. Patriotic commitment to national ideals such as liberty and justice may translate into support for international norms and alliances that deter aggression.

Therefore, the character of patriotism matters. Education that promotes critical thinking, historical literacy, and empathy can inoculate societies against jingoism. Media pluralism and robust civic institutions enable scrutiny of leadersâ€™ claims. Importantly, patriotism should be framed not as superiority over others but as responsibility to uphold shared values.

In practical terms, everyday patriotism looks like volunteering, voting, paying taxes fairly, and protecting minority rightsâ€”actions that strengthen the social fabric and reduce the likelihood that reckless leaders can rally a nation to war.

In conclusion, patriotism itself does not inevitably cause war; its misuse does. Cultivating reflective, values-based patriotism helps prevent conflict and restrain unethical leaders.


Furthermore, practical implementation should be guided by clear metrics, reasonable timelines, and regular public reporting. Schools, employers, and local authorities can pilot small-scale initiatives, gather feedback, and iterate rather than attempting one-size-fits-all reforms. By pairing policy with education, investing in capacity, and tracking outcomes, stakeholders can adapt quickly, scale what works, and ensure that benefits are distributed fairly across communities. This pragmatic, evidence-led approach reduces unintended consequences, strengthens public trust, and makes the overall strategy more resilient to economic shocks and social change.
14) Nov 7, 2022 â€” Some feel that punishment should focus more on rehabilitation instead of long prison terms. Others feel prison terms are important for social stability. Discuss both sides and give your opinion. (Discussion essay)

Debate persists over whether punishment should emphasize rehabilitation or rely on lengthy incarceration to ensure social stability. I contend that rehabilitation should be the priority for most offenders, while proportionate prison terms remain necessary for serious crimes and public safety.

Long sentences may deter some crime and incapacitate dangerous individuals. They can reassure the public and provide time for investigations. However, evidence indicates diminishing returns: extended incarceration often increases recidivism by severing social ties and limiting employment prospects. Overcrowded prisons strain budgets without delivering commensurate benefits.

Rehabilitationâ€”education, vocational training, therapy, and restorative justiceâ€”addresses underlying causes of crime. Countries that invest in these approaches often report lower reoffending and better reintegration outcomes. For non-violent offenders, community-based sentences combined with treatment are typically more cost-effective and humane.

A balanced model is possible: clear sentencing guidelines, risk assessment tools, and individualized plans that prioritize rehabilitation where appropriate, with prison reserved for those who pose ongoing threats. Post-release supportâ€”housing, job placement, and mentorshipâ€”is crucial to sustain gains.

Additionally, centering victims within restorative processes can enhance legitimacy and healing. When offenders confront the human impact of their actions and agree reparative steps, communities often perceive justice as more than mere confinement. Evidence from Nordic systems and selected U.S. jurisdictions shows that such approaches can reduce reoffending while maintaining public confidence.

In summary, social stability is best achieved through smart justice: rehabilitation-first policies that reduce reoffending, complemented by necessary imprisonment in proportion to harm.


Furthermore, practical implementation should be guided by clear metrics, reasonable timelines, and regular public reporting. Schools, employers, and local authorities can pilot small-scale initiatives, gather feedback, and iterate rather than attempting one-size-fits-all reforms. By pairing policy with education, investing in capacity, and tracking outcomes, stakeholders can adapt quickly, scale what works, and ensure that benefits are distributed fairly across communities. This pragmatic, evidence-led approach reduces unintended consequences, strengthens public trust, and makes the overall strategy more resilient to economic shocks and social change.
15) Nov 2, 2022 â€” Some young people like to copy the behaviour and clothes of famous people today. Why might this be the case? What problems can it cause? (Two-part question)

Young people often emulate famous figuresâ€™ behavior and fashion. This tendency arises from psychological, social, and technological factors, and it can create several challenges.

One reason is identity formation. Adolescence is a period of experimentation; celebrities provide ready-made templates for style and values. Social media intensifies parasocial relationships, making fans feel personally connected to public figures. Algorithms further amplify celebrity content, normalizing their choices and accelerating trends. Peer pressure also plays a role: adopting popular looks can secure social acceptance.

However, imitation can cause problems. Unrealistic beauty standards may foster body dissatisfaction, eating disorders, or excessive spending on cosmetic products. Risky behaviorsâ€”extreme dieting, vape culture, or dangerous challengesâ€”can be copied without understanding consequences. Moreover, prioritizing image over substance can distract from education or skill development, limiting future prospects.

To mitigate these issues, media literacy education should teach critical evaluation of online personas, including disclosure of sponsorships and editing. Parents can model balanced consumption and discuss values behind lifestyle choices. Platforms should enforce stricter policies on harmful content and require clearer labelling of modified images.

Schools can also integrate discussions of celebrity culture into citizenship curricula, encouraging students to analyze role modelsâ€™ achievements beyond surface imageâ€”philanthropy, professional discipline, resilience after failure. Celebrating local heroesâ€”teachers, nurses, entrepreneursâ€”broadens the range of aspirational identities and reduces unhealthy fixation on fame.

In conclusion, emulating celebrities is understandable but can be harmful without guidance. Empowering young people to make informed, authentic choices reduces risks while allowing healthy self-expression.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2023


Furthermore, practical implementation should be guided by clear metrics, reasonable timelines, and regular public reporting. Schools, employers, and local authorities can pilot small-scale initiatives, gather feedback, and iterate rather than attempting one-size-fits-all reforms. By pairing policy with education, investing in capacity, and tracking outcomes, stakeholders can adapt quickly, scale what works, and ensure that benefits are distributed fairly across communities. This pragmatic, evidence-led approach reduces unintended consequences, strengthens public trust, and makes the overall strategy more resilient to economic shocks and social change.
1) Dec 30, 2023 â€” Nowadays, there is more and more competition for getting into university. Is this a positive or negative development? (Advantage/Disadvantage essay)

The increasing competition for university admission is a defining feature of modern education systems. While this trend can spur academic excellence, it also poses risks to equity and student well-being. On balance, I view it as a mixed development that requires policy intervention.

On the positive side, competition motivates students to work diligently, pursue extracurricular activities, and develop strong study habits. Universities, in turn, raise standards, enhancing research quality and graduate outcomes. Employers benefit from a larger pool of capable candidates, contributing to national productivity.

However, excessive competition induces stress and narrows learning. Students may prioritize test-taking over curiosity, and families with resources can secure advantages through private tutoring and enrichment programs, exacerbating inequality. Moreover, not all careers require academic pathways; societal overemphasis on university can devalue vocational routes, leading to skills mismatches and underemployment.

A balanced approach is needed. Expanding high-quality tertiary optionsâ€”including apprenticeships and community collegesâ€”relieves pressure while aligning training with labor market needs. Transparent admissions criteria that recognize diverse achievements, alongside targeted support for disadvantaged students, can improve fairness. Schools should emphasize holistic education, including mental health support and career guidance that highlights multiple pathways to success.

Furthermore, moderate quotas for first-generation or regional applicants, combined with bridge programs and mentoring, can offset structural disadvantages without diluting standards. Public campaigns that elevate the status of skilled trades also rebalance aspirations and reduce unhealthy bottlenecks at elite universities.

In conclusion, competition can drive performance but must not become an unhealthy arms race. With diversified opportunities and equitable policies, societies can harness the benefits while mitigating the drawbacks.

2) Dec 25, 2023 â€” The demand for coaching services has grown significantly in the digital age, with online coaching platforms becoming prevalent. Some now feel online coaching is a superior option to in-person coaching. To what extent do you agree or disagree? (Opinion essay)

The digital age has seen an explosion in online coaching platforms across domains from fitness to career development. Although virtual coaching offers significant advantages, I do not believe it is inherently superior to in-person coaching; the best choice depends on goals, context, and individual learning preferences.

Online coaching excels in accessibility and flexibility. Clients can schedule sessions across time zones, choose from a global pool of coaches, and review recorded sessions. Digital toolsâ€”shared dashboards, progress trackers, and messagingâ€”enhance accountability. Costs are often lower due to reduced overheads, broadening access.

In-person coaching, however, benefits from richer non-verbal cues and deeper rapport, particularly in sensitive areas such as executive presence, therapeutic coaching, or complex interpersonal dynamics. Physical co-presence can facilitate experiential exercisesâ€”role-plays, workshopsâ€”that are harder to replicate online. For some, the ritual of meeting face-to-face increases commitment.

A hybrid model frequently outperforms either format alone. Initial in-person sessions can establish trust and assess nuanced communication, followed by online meetings for convenience. Outcomes improve when tools are chosen based on client needs rather than delivery mode. Effective coaches adapt: they employ high-quality video setups, structured agendas, and reflective practices online, while leveraging embodied techniques offline.

In addition, data security and privacy require careful handling online. Clear contracts, compliant platforms, and ethical boundaries ensure clients feel as safe as they would in a private office. When these safeguards are in place, modality becomes a strategic choice rather than a constraint.

In summary, online coaching is a powerful alternative but not universally superior. Matching modality to objectives, and blending formats where feasible, delivers the best results.

3) Dec 4, 2023 â€” Financial education should be included as a mandatory subject in schools to prepare students for managing money effectively. To what extent do you agree or disagree? (Opinion essay)

Calls to make financial education compulsory reflect widespread concerns about debt, low savings, and complex financial products. I strongly support integrating financial literacy into school curricula, though it must be practical, age-appropriate, and complemented by consumer protections.

Financial skills are life skills. Understanding budgeting, compound interest, credit scores, and basic investing can prevent costly mistakes and enhance economic mobility. Early exposure instills habits such as saving and goal-setting. Countries that embedded financial literacy often report improved behaviors, including higher participation in retirement plans.

Skeptics note that knowledge does not always translate into action, especially under stress or when products are predatory. This is why curriculum design matters: simulations, project-based tasks (e.g., managing a mock paycheck), and real-life applications increase retention. Partnerships with credit unions or fintech sandboxes can provide safe, hands-on experiences.

Nonetheless, education alone is insufficient. Policy measuresâ€”clear disclosures, caps on exploitative fees, and default enrollment in savings programsâ€”create supportive environments. Parents should also be engaged, as family attitudes strongly shape money behaviors.

Finally, assessment should incentivize real-world application: student-run enterprises, investment clubs with virtual portfolios, and community service tax-prep projects make finance tangible. Tying lessons to local costs of living and career planning further anchors concepts in studentsâ€™ immediate futures.

In conclusion, mandatory financial education is an essential part of preparing students for adulthood. Coupled with smart regulation and community involvement, it can materially improve financial well-being.

4) Dec 2, 2023 â€” Some people think the manufacturers and shopping malls should sell fewer packaged products while others argue that people have the responsibility to buy products with less packaging. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. (Discussion essay)

Excessive packaging contributes to waste and pollution. Some argue that manufacturers and retailers should sell fewer packaged products, while others insist consumers must choose options with less packaging. Both parties share responsibility, but producers should lead due to their greater control and scale.

Producers design packaging and supply chains. By adopting eco-design principlesâ€”right-sizing, recyclable materials, and refill systemsâ€”they can reduce waste before it is created. Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policies, where firms finance collection and recycling, incentivize sustainable choices. Retailers can support bulk aisles, standardized returnable containers, and clear labelling to guide customers.

Consumers influence demand through purchasing decisions. Choosing minimally packaged goods and bringing reusable bags or containers sends a market signal. However, individual choices are constrained by availability, price, and information asymmetry. Low-income households may prioritize cost and convenience, especially where sustainable options are limited.

Therefore, systemic change must come from the top. Governments can mandate recycled content, ban problematic materials, and harmonize recycling standards. Producers should innovate and absorb some costs, which can decline over time as economies of scale develop. Education campaigns and nudgesâ€”such as defaulting to no-cutlery for deliveriesâ€”amplify impact.

Real-world evidence supports this approach: deposit-return schemes for bottles, standardized refill systems for household products, and fee shifts onto hard-to-recycle formats have driven measurable waste reductions without burdening consumers disproportionately.

In summary, while consumers play an important role, producers and policymakers hold the levers that make low-packaging choices practical and affordable. Leadership at that level is indispensable.


Furthermore, practical implementation should be guided by clear metrics, reasonable timelines, and regular public reporting. Schools, employers, and local authorities can pilot small-scale initiatives, gather feedback, and iterate rather than attempting one-size-fits-all reforms. By pairing policy with education, investing in capacity, and tracking outcomes, stakeholders can adapt quickly, scale what works, and ensure that benefits are distributed fairly across communities.

5) Nov 17, 2023 â€” Environmental damage is a problem in most countries. What is the cause of this damage? What should be done about this problem? (Problem/Solution essay)

Environmental degradation stems from intertwined drivers: unsustainable resource extraction, fossil fuel dependence, industrial agriculture, and linear â€œtake-make-disposeâ€ consumption. Urban sprawl and weak governance exacerbate these pressures.

Addressing this requires coordinated action. Governments should price externalities through carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems, directing revenue to clean energy and just transition programs. Strengthening environmental regulations, monitoring, and enforcement can curb pollution and habitat loss. Investment in public transport and compact urban design reduces emissions and preserves land.

Industry must innovate toward circular economy modelsâ€”designing products for durability, repair, and recycling. Renewable energy adoption, energy efficiency upgrades, and regenerative agriculture practices (crop rotation, soil restoration) can significantly cut impacts. Supply chain transparency, verified by third-party standards, builds accountability.

Individuals contribute by reducing waste, shifting to plant-rich diets, and supporting responsible brands and policies. However, personal actions are most effective when enabled by infrastructure: reliable public transit, affordable clean energy, and accessible recycling.

International cooperation is also crucial. Technology transfer, green finance for developing countries, and joint standards on deforestation-free supply chains prevent pollution havens and align incentives globally.

In conclusion, environmental damage is systemic but solvable. Aligning incentives, technology, and behavior through ambitious yet fair policies can reverse current trends.

1) Dec 16, 2024 â€” Some countries have legal ages at which people can drink. Other countries believe not having strict laws is a better policy. Discuss both and give your opinion. (Discussion essay)

Countries differ on whether to set legal drinking ages. Some maintain strict age limits to protect youth, while others rely on cultural norms and education. Both models aim to reduce harm; I favor clear minimum ages combined with evidence-based prevention.

Legal ages are grounded in public health. The adolescent brain remains in development; early alcohol use correlates with dependency and cognitive issues. Age limits help delay initiation, reduce access at parties, and simplify enforcement against underage sales. Jurisdictions with robust ID checks and server training often report fewer alcohol-related accidents among youths.

Opponents argue that prohibition fosters rebellion and unsafe, clandestine drinking. They propose teaching responsible consumption within families or communities, as practiced in some cultures where alcohol is integrated into meals. Indeed, rigid laws without education can push behavior underground.

A hybrid approach works best. Maintain a minimum legal age to align with developmental science and provide a clear legal framework. Simultaneously, implement comprehensive educationâ€”school programs on risks, parental guidance, and community norms that discourage binge drinking. Graduated licensing for alcohol service and strict penalties for drunk driving protect the broader public.

Moreover, policy can acknowledge cultural variation by allowing supervised consumption in educational settings (for example, culinary schools) while maintaining strong retail age limits. This preserves learning contexts without widening access for minors.

In summary, clear legal ages are necessary but not sufficient. When combined with cultural education and targeted enforcement, they effectively reduce alcohol-related harm.


Furthermore, practical implementation should be guided by clear metrics, reasonable timelines, and regular public reporting.

2) Dec 14, 2024 â€” Today, many people do not know their neighbors. Why is this? What can be done about this? (Problem/Solution essay)

Many people today scarcely know their neighbors. Several factors contribute: longer working hours, digital entertainment replacing local leisure, high residential turnover, and urban designs that prioritize cars over public spaces. Apartment living can also limit casual encounters.

To address this, cities should design for interaction. Mixed-use neighborhoods, safe sidewalks, community gardens, and shared courtyards create natural meeting points. Local authorities can support block parties with streamlined permits and small grants. Building managers might facilitate welcome events for new residents.

Technology can be part of the solution. Neighborhood apps, when moderated, enable information sharing and mutual aid without replacing face-to-face contact. Libraries and schools can host skills exchanges, book clubs, and volunteering hubs that bring residents together across ages and backgrounds.

Individuals also play a role: simple gesturesâ€”introducing oneself, offering help, organizing a small gatheringâ€”can break the ice. Over time, these micro-interactions build trust that pays dividends during emergencies.

Employers and housing providers can help too by scheduling community hours, supporting daycare co-ops, and creating shared work lounges in residential buildings. These structural nudges reduce friction and turn proximity into familiarity.

In conclusion, anonymity is not inevitable. With intentional design, supportive institutions, and small acts of initiative, communities can become more connected and resilient.

3) Dec 4, 2024 â€” Caring for children is probably the most important job in any society. Because of this, all mothers and fathers should be required to take a course that prepares them to be good parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view? (Opinion essay)

Parenting profoundly shapes childrenâ€™s outcomes, leading some to propose compulsory courses for all prospective parents. While the goal of better parenting is laudable, I am cautious about universal mandates. Instead, I support highly accessible, incentivized programs integrated into healthcare and community services.

Mandatory courses raise practical and ethical concerns. Enforcement would be difficult and risks penalizing vulnerable families. A one-size-fits-all curriculum may not respect cultural diversity or unique child needs. Moreover, compulsion can breed resistance rather than engagement.

Nevertheless, evidence-based parenting educationâ€”on attachment, positive discipline, nutrition, and early literacyâ€”improves child well-being. Universal access through prenatal clinics, pediatric visits, and online modules can normalize participation without coercion. Incentives such as childcare credits or health insurance reductions can encourage uptake. Tailored tracksâ€”for first-time parents, single parents, or caregivers of children with disabilitiesâ€”ensure relevance.

Complementary supports matter: home-visiting programs, parental leave policies, and affordable childcare translate knowledge into practice. Community peer groups reduce isolation and provide ongoing problem-solving.

Crucially, delivery should be respectful and strengths-based, recognizing familiesâ€™ existing wisdom. Co-design with parents, inclusion of fathers, and flexible scheduling (evenings, online, multilingual) will maximize participation and impact.

In summary, parenting education should be widely available and strongly encouraged, not mandated. Respectful, culturally sensitive design will maximize impact and participation.


Furthermore, practical implementation should be guided by clear metrics, reasonable timelines, and regular public reporting.

4) Nov 20, 2024 â€” Some people believe that housing is a basic human right for all individuals. To what extent do you agree or disagree? (Opinion essay)

The assertion that housing is a basic human right reflects the idea that shelter is foundational to dignity, health, and participation in society. I agree with this principle and believe governments should guarantee access to adequate housing, using a range of policy tools.

Stable housing reduces healthcare costs, improves educational outcomes, and enables employment. Market forces alone often fail to house low-income households, especially in high-demand cities with limited supply. Therefore, public intervention is justified.

Policies should tackle both supply and affordability. Upzoning and streamlined approvals increase housing stock, particularly near transit. Public and non-profit housing can serve those the market cannot. Housing vouchers, inclusionary zoning, and rent stabilization (carefully designed to avoid disinvestment) can bridge affordability gaps. Preventing homelessness through eviction diversion, emergency assistance, and supportive housing for those with complex needs is essential.

Critics fear high fiscal burdens and market distortions. Yet, long-term savings in social services and the moral imperative to prevent homelessness argue for investment. Accountabilityâ€”transparent procurement, rigorous evaluation, and community involvementâ€”ensures funds are used effectively.

Funding can be diversified: land-value capture around transit, social impact bonds for supportive housing, and public land trusts that remove speculation from the equation. These tools reduce pressure on general budgets while preserving affordability over generations.

In conclusion, recognizing housing as a right guides policy towards inclusive, resilient cities where everyone has a secure place to live.


Furthermore, practical implementation should be guided by clear metrics, reasonable timelines, and regular public reporting.

5) Nov 3, 2024 â€” Some feel that tourism endangers culture while others feel it is beneficial. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion. (Discussion essay)

Tourismâ€™s impact on culture is ambivalent. On one hand, it can commercialize traditions and displace residents; on the other, it funds preservation and fosters intercultural understanding. I believe tourism can be culturally beneficial if managed thoughtfully.

Negative outcomes arise when destinations pursue volume over value. Overcrowding strains heritage sites, and souvenir markets may reduce rich traditions to stereotypes. Short-term rentals can inflate rents, pushing artists and communities out. Cultural performances staged solely for tourists risk losing authenticity.

Yet tourism can revive crafts, finance conservation, and create pride in local heritage. Community-led initiatives ensure benefits remain local: homestays, cooperative marketplaces, and participatory museums give residents agency. Interpretation centers and codes of conduct educate visitors on respectful behavior.

Policy is pivotal. Implementing visitor caps, differential pricing, and timed entries protects fragile sites. Certification schemes for cultural tours and fair-trade crafts help travelers choose responsibly. Revenue-sharing mechanisms and training programs empower local custodians.

Examples abound: restricted access at Machu Picchu, time-slotting in Venice, and community conservancies in Kenya show that rules plus local leadership can balance preservation with livelihoods.

In summary, tourism is not inherently harmful. When communities set the terms and authorities enforce protections, cultural heritage can thrive alongside a sustainable visitor economy.

1) Jan 30, 2025 â€” Today many teenagers rely greatly on technology when learning. Is this a positive or negative development? (Advantage/Disadvantage essay)

The growing reliance of teenagers on technology for learning provokes debate. Technology offers unprecedented access and personalization, but it also introduces distractions and equity concerns. Overall, it is a positive development if integrated with pedagogy and supported by safeguards.

Advantages include adaptive learning platforms that tailor content to studentsâ€™ pace, immediate feedback that reinforces understanding, and rich multimedia that brings abstract concepts to life. Collaboration tools facilitate group projects and connect classrooms globally. Assistive technologies support learners with disabilities, enhancing inclusion.

However, risks are real. Constant connectivity can fragment attention, and multitasking undermines deep learning. Not all students have reliable devices or internet, widening the digital divide. Overreliance on automated systems may weaken critical thinking if teachers do not guide inquiry and metacognition.

To maximize benefits, schools should adopt a â€œtech with purposeâ€ approach: select tools that solve specific pedagogical problems, train teachers, and set norms for focused use. Offline alternatives and device lending programs can address inequality. Digital literacyâ€”evaluating sources, managing attention, and protecting privacyâ€”must be taught explicitly.

Teacher professional development is the hinge: when educators are confident using analytics and curating resources, technology enhancesâ€”not replacesâ€”high-quality instruction. Clear device policies and thoughtfully designed lessons convert potential distraction into active learning time.

In conclusion, technology dependence can elevate learning outcomes when used thoughtfully. The goal is not more screens but better learning experiences.


Furthermore, practical implementation should be guided by clear metrics, reasonable timelines, and regular public reporting.

2) Jan 24, 2025 â€” Some believe that the government should support artists like musicians, painters, and poets, while others argue that this is a misuse of funds. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. (Discussion essay)

Public funding for the arts divides opinion. Supporters argue that artists enrich culture and public life; critics prefer spending on essential services. I believe governments should fund the arts, provided mechanisms ensure public value and accountability.

The arts generate social and economic returns. They foster creativity, civic identity, and well-being, and they attract tourism and investment. Many formsâ€”experimental theatre, community arts, preservationâ€”are public goods that markets underprovide. Grants can diversify voices and nurture talent that would otherwise be excluded.

Skeptics worry about opportunity costs and subjective judgments. To address this, funding bodies should use transparent criteria, independent peer review, and rigorous evaluation of outreach and impact. Prioritizing accessâ€”free performances, education programs, regional equityâ€”ensures broader benefits. Public-private partnerships can leverage additional resources.

In practice, modest per-capita investments can sustain local venues, festivals, and youth programs that have measurable effects on community cohesion and downtown vitality. When health and education partners co-fund arts initiativesâ€”music therapy, arts-in-schoolsâ€”the spending complements core services.

In sum, arts funding is not a luxury but a strategic investment in a vibrant, cohesive society. With good governance, it complements rather than competes with essential services.

3) Jan 22, 2025 â€” Some argue that schools should prioritize life skills such as working in teams and solving problems instead of traditional academics. To what extent do you agree or disagree? (Opinion essay)

Some argue schools should foreground life skillsâ€”teamwork, problem-solvingâ€”over traditional academics. I support elevating life skills but not at the expense of core knowledge. The two are interdependent.

Complex problem-solving requires a knowledge base. Critical thinking in science depends on understanding scientific concepts; collaboration in history projects draws on factual literacy. Conversely, knowledge is inert without the ability to apply it. Therefore, pedagogy should integrate skills and content through authentic tasks.

Project-based learning, debate, and interdisciplinary units allow students to practice communication and creativity while mastering curricula. Assessment should capture processâ€”planning, reflectionâ€”alongside outcomes. Partnerships with local businesses and NGOs can provide real-world challenges.

Concrete examples include student-run enterprises that apply maths and marketing, design challenges that merge physics and art, and civic projects that combine research with public speaking. Rubrics that reward iteration and feedback literacy reinforce the habits of effective teams.

In short, schools should not choose between life skills and academics. They should teach both in tandem to prepare students for dynamic futures. Concretely, curricula can weave skills into content through rubrics that assess collaboration and reflection alongside subject mastery, ensuring rigor remains intact. Regular exhibitions of learning and peer critique cycles further embed transferable skills without sacrificing academic depth. In addition, timetable design can protect extended studio blocks and lab time so students experience sustained inquiry, while advisory programs build metacognition and goal setting - two capacities that anchor lifelong learning. Publishing clear competency maps that align projects with explicit outcomes helps families and employers see how academic knowledge and life skills develop together.


Furthermore, practical implementation should be guided by clear metrics, reasonable timelines, and regular public reporting. Schools, employers, and local authorities can pilot small-scale initiatives, gather feedback, and iterate rather than attempting one-size-fits-all reforms.

4) Jan 12, 2025 â€” Some people argue that parents should have a strong influence on their childrenâ€™s choice of friends and life partners. Others believe that young people should make these decisions independently. Discuss both views and give your opinion. (Discussion essay)

Whether parents should strongly influence their childrenâ€™s choice of friends and life partners is sensitive. Some favor guidance to protect against harmful relationships; others defend young peopleâ€™s autonomy. I advocate for a supportive, advisory role rather than direct control.

Parental insight can be valuable. Adults may recognize red flagsâ€”manipulation, substance abuseâ€”that adolescents overlook. Open conversations about values and boundaries can prevent unhealthy dynamics. In cultures where family networks are central, parental involvement can also facilitate social compatibility.

Yet heavy-handed control can backfire, breeding secrecy and resentment. Autonomy is critical for identity formation and long-term relationship satisfaction. Ultimately, individuals must own their choices to learn and grow.

The ideal is a trust-based approach: parents model respectful relationships, set clear expectations about safety, and create space for dialogue. If genuine concerns arise, they can express them calmly and offer support without ultimatums.

Importantly, safeguarding frameworksâ€”discussing consent, digital safety, and coercive controlâ€”equip young people to evaluate relationships independently. Parents who focus on principles rather than policing help children internalize sound judgment.

In conclusion, parents should influence indirectly through guidance and example, while respecting young peopleâ€™s right to choose.


Furthermore, practical implementation should be guided by clear metrics, reasonable timelines, and regular public reporting.

5) Jan 4, 2025 â€” The increasing frequency of satellite launches and space debris is becoming a threat to the Earth. What are the main causes? What measures can be taken to address this? (Problem/Solution essay)

The surge in satellite launches, driven by cheaper rockets and commercial constellations, has increased orbital debris, threatening spacecraft and even ground infrastructure. Debris accumulates through fragmentation from collisions and anti-satellite tests, defunct satellites, and spent rocket stages.

Mitigating this requires international coordination. First, adopt and enforce debris mitigation standards: deorbit satellites within five years of end-of-life, passivate fuel tanks, and design for controlled reentry. Second, license launch frequency and constellation sizes based on traffic management frameworks that account for collision risk. Third, invest in space situational awareness and active debris removalâ€”robotic capture, drag sails, and laser nudgingâ€”to address legacy junk.

Market mechanisms can help: insurance premiums and licensing fees tied to debris footprints incentivize cleaner designs. Transparencyâ€”publicly sharing orbital dataâ€”enables better avoidance maneuvers. Militaries should cease destructive anti-satellite tests and pursue norms through the UN.

Engineers should also prioritize interoperability and standardized docking interfaces so that future servicing and refueling extend satellite lifetimes and reduce abandonment. Preventing Kessler Syndrome is cheaper than cleaning it up.

In conclusion, space remains a shared domain. With enforceable rules, technological innovation, and responsible state behavior, growth in satellite services can continue without compromising orbital safety.


Furthermore, practical implementation should be guided by clear metrics, reasonable timelines, and regular public reporting.

6) Jan 1, 2025 â€” In recent years, there has been a rise in the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports. What are the consequences of doping for athletes? What measures should be taken to combat this issue? (Problem/Solution essay)

The rise of performance-enhancing drugs threatens the integrity of sport. Consequences for athletes include severe health risksâ€”cardiovascular strain, hormonal disorders, psychological effectsâ€”and reputational damage that can end careers. Doping also erodes fair play, alienates fans, and pressures clean athletes to follow suit.

Combating this requires comprehensive strategies. Anti-doping agencies need adequate funding for out-of-competition testing, biological passports, and advanced analytics to detect micro-dosing. Strict but fair sanctions, coupled with whistleblower protections, deter violations. Education programs starting at youth levels must address ethics, nutrition, and the long-term harms of doping.

Sports bodies should align incentives: limit schedules that encourage overtraining, ensure access to qualified medical staff, and reward clean performance. Collaboration with law enforcement helps dismantle trafficking networks. Transparency in testing results builds public trust.

Athlete unions and sponsors have roles too. Contract clauses tied to clean sport, mental health support, and confidential reporting channels reduce perverse incentives. Recognizing and celebrating athletes who exemplify clean excellence shifts norms toward health and integrity.

In summary, safeguarding sport demands science-based enforcement, athlete education, and cultures that value health over short-term gains.

1) Some people believe academic subjects should be prioritized in school, while others think practical skills are more important. Discuss both views and give your opinion. (Discussion essay)

Debate continues over whether schools should place greater emphasis on academic disciplines or on practical skills. Supporters of traditional subjects argue that mathematics, science, and languages build abstract thinking, logical reasoning, and cultural literacy. These subjects help students evaluate evidence, synthesize ideas, and engage in informed citizenship. High-level conceptual knowledge is also a durable asset: while specific tools change, the ability to model a problem or interpret data remains valuable across careers.

By contrast, proponents of practical skills highlight employability and life readiness. Financial literacy, digital fluency, communication, and craftsmanship enable students to apply knowledge in concrete settings. Such skills can open diverse pathways into trades and entrepreneurship, reducing youth unemployment and addressing skills shortages. Practical learning also increases motivation because students see an immediate link between classroom tasks and real-world outcomes.

In my view, this is a false dichotomy. The most effective systems integrate both strands. Contextualized learningâ€”coding to teach algebraic thinking, fieldwork to apply scientific methods, or student enterprises to develop numeracy and teamworkâ€”bridges theory and practice. Assessment, too, should reflect this blend by valuing process (planning, collaboration, reflection) alongside mastery of content.

Ultimately, schools should prioritize coherence, not hierarchy. A curriculum that sequences core academic knowledge and systematically embeds practical application prepares students for further study and immediate contribution to society. Integration, not replacement, is the way forward.

2) Online learning is becoming more popular than traditional classroom learning. Do you think this is a positive or negative development? (Opinion essay)

The rapid expansion of online learning has transformed education, raising the question of whether this shift is beneficial. I consider the trend positive overall, provided it is implemented within thoughtful pedagogical frameworks rather than as a cost-cutting substitute for in-person teaching.

Online platforms democratize access. Working adults, caregivers, and rural learners can study flexibly, and recorded lectures support mastery learning through pause-and-replay functionality. Adaptive systems personalize practice and flag misconceptions early, while discussion boards and collaborative documents foster peer interaction across borders. Moreover, data analytics give instructors granular insight into participation and comprehension, enabling targeted intervention.

However, remote learning poses risks if poorly designed. Digital fatigue, uneven connectivity, and limited space at home can undermine engagement and equity. Purely asynchronous formats may reduce accountability and diminish spontaneity in discussion. Practical subjectsâ€”laboratory sciences, performing arts, clinical trainingâ€”require hands-on experiences that are difficult to replicate online. Finally, schools are social institutions; they cultivate belonging, soft skills, and wellbeing that screens alone cannot provide.

The optimal model is blended. Deliver content-heavy lectures online to free classroom time for Socratic dialogue, labs, and coaching. Equip teachers with instructional design support and inclusive technologies (captioning, accessible materials) to widen participation. Institutions must also invest in infrastructureâ€”device lending, stable platforms, and study spacesâ€”to ensure no student is left behind.

In sum, online learning is a powerful addition to the educational toolkit. Used strategically to complement face-to-face teaching, it enhances access and outcomes; used indiscriminately, it can erode quality and inclusion.

3) Some argue that university education should focus on preparing students for specific jobs, while others think it should provide a broad education. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. (Discussion essay)

Universities face pressure to produce job-ready graduates, yet they are also guardians of broad intellectual development. Advocates of career-focused programs emphasize alignment with labor market needs. Work-integrated learning, certifications, and industry partnerships can accelerate entry into employment and signal competence to recruiters. In rapidly evolving sectors, applied training keeps curricula current and demonstrably useful.

Conversely, supporters of a broad education contend that specialization without breadth risks obsolescence. Critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and communication are portable across roles and resilient to technological change. Exposure to history, philosophy, and the arts expands perspective, enabling graduates to navigate ambiguity, collaborate across disciplines, and make responsible decisionsâ€”capacities vital for leadership.

I believe universities should reject the zero-sum framing and design paths that deliver both. A strong major provides depth, while general education ensures range. Capstone projects, internships, and community-engaged learning translate knowledge into action. Interdisciplinary minorsâ€”such as data science for biologists or ethics for computer scientistsâ€”further integrate breadth with vocation.

Quality assurance should measure not only short-term employment but long-term adaptability and civic contribution. Graduates who can learn new tools, ask better questions, and work with diverse teams will thrive. Thus, universities best serve students and society by fusing practical preparation with broad intellectual formation.

4) Climate change is one of the biggest threats to humanity. What are the causes, and what solutions can governments and individuals take? (Problem/Solution essay)

Anthropogenic climate change is driven primarily by greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels for energy and transport, industrial processes, and deforestation. Agriculture contributes significant methane and nitrous oxide through livestock and fertilizers, while land-use change reduces natural carbon sinks. Feedbacksâ€”melting ice, permafrost thawâ€”risk amplifying warming beyond linear projections.

Addressing this threat demands systemic action. Governments should phase out fossil fuel subsidies and implement carbon pricing to internalize environmental costs, using revenue to support low-income households and fund green infrastructure. Massive investment is needed to expand renewables, modernize grids, and scale storage. Policies must also accelerate electrification of vehicles and heating, set efficiency standards for buildings and appliances, and protect and restore forests, peatlands, and mangroves.

Resilience requires climate-proofing cities: cool roofs, urban forests, and flood defenses reduce heat and storm impacts. Agricultural transitionsâ€”precision irrigation, diversified crops, soil restorationâ€”can cut emissions and increase food security. Internationally, technology transfer and climate finance should enable developing countries to leapfrog to cleaner growth.

Individuals remain pivotal as voters, consumers, and community members. Choosing low-carbon transport, reducing food waste, and adopting plant-rich diets lower personal footprints, while supporting climate-forward policies multiplies impact. Community initiativesâ€”local energy co-ops, repair cafes, tree plantingâ€”build momentum and social norms.

In sum, aligning markets, technology, and behavior through ambitious, fair policy can still bend the curve. With shared responsibility and sustained effort, societies can mitigate warming and adapt to unavoidable change.

5) Some people believe that individuals can do nothing to improve the environment. Only governments and large companies can make a difference. To what extent do you agree or disagree? (Opinion essay)

It is often argued that environmental problems are so vast that only states and corporations can meaningfully address them. While systemic action is indispensable, I disagree that individuals are powerless. Personal choices, civic engagement, and community initiatives both reduce direct impacts and reshape institutional behavior.

First, aggregated individual actions matter. Household energy efficiency, reduced meat consumption, and modal shifts to walking, cycling, or transit measurably cut emissions and pollution. These choices also create markets for greener products, prompting firms to innovate and scale sustainable options, which in turn lowers prices for all.

Second, individuals wield influence beyond consumption. As voters and advocates, they can press governments for robust policiesâ€”carbon pricing, nature protection, clean air standardsâ€”and hold leaders accountable. As employees and shareholders, they can drive corporate sustainability from within, linking executive incentives to environmental performance and supporting transparent reporting.

That said, there are limits to voluntarism. Without supportive infrastructureâ€”safe bike lanes, reliable transit, affordable renewablesâ€”people face constrained options. Moreover, the largest emitters sit upstream in energy and heavy industry, where policy and capital allocation dominate outcomes.

Therefore, the relationship is complementary, not binary. Governments and companies must lead with structural change, but individuals catalyze and legitimize that change through daily choices and democratic participation. Dismissing personal agency becomes a self-fulfilling excuse; embracing it accelerates collective progress.


Furthermore, practical implementation should be guided by clear metrics, reasonable timelines, and regular public reporting. Schools, employers, and local authorities can pilot small-scale initiatives, gather feedback, and iterate rather than attempting one-size-fits-all reforms.

6) Over-packaging of consumer goods causes environmental problems. Who should take responsibilityâ€”producers or consumers? (Discussion essay)

Over-packaging increases resource use and waste, pollutes ecosystems, and burdens municipal budgets. Responsibility is shared, but producers should bear primary accountability because they control design, materials, and supply chains at scale.

Producers can eliminate unnecessary layers, right-size containers, and switch to recyclable, compostable, or reusable formats. Designing for disassembly and standardizing components facilitate recovery. Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemesâ€”where companies finance collection and recyclingâ€”align incentives: the more waste created, the higher the cost. Retailers can support bulk aisles, refill stations, and clear labelling that communicates end-of-life pathways and true recyclability.

Consumers are not irrelevant. Choosing minimally packaged goods, bringing reusables, and sorting waste correctly signal demand and improve recovery rates. However, choices are constrained by availability, price, and information asymmetry. It is unrealisticâ€”and inequitableâ€”to expect households, particularly low-income ones, to bear the burden for system-level design failures.

Governments are the third pillar. Bans on the most problematic materials, recycled-content mandates, harmonized labelling, and procurement standards create a level playing field and accelerate adoption. Investments in collection and sorting infrastructure, funded in part by EPR, close the loop.

In conclusion, consumers contribute, but producers must lead under clear rules. When design responsibility and end-of-life costs sit with those who shape packaging, environmental outcomes improve and sustainable choices become the affordable default.

7) Some people think artificial intelligence will replace teachers in the future. Do you agree or disagree? (Opinion essay)

Artificial intelligence is reshaping education, yet I disagree that it will replace teachers. AI excels at tasks such as adaptive practice, automated feedback on routine assignments, and data-driven identification of learning gaps. These functions can personalize pathways and free educatorsâ€™ time for higher-value work.

However, teaching is fundamentally relational and ethical. Teachers build trust, motivate reluctant learners, mediate conflict, and model intellectual curiosity. They design rich learning experiences, orchestrate discussion, and provide nuanced feedback on complex workâ€”skills grounded in empathy and professional judgment that current AI cannot authentically replicate. In safeguarding wellbeing and inclusion, human presence is indispensable.

The future is teacher-led and AI-augmented. Thoughtfully integrated tools can support formative assessment, differentiate instruction, and expand access to resources. Professional development should equip teachers to interpret analytics, ensure academic integrity, and mitigate bias in algorithms. Schools must also address digital equity and establish clear policies on data privacy and transparency.

In short, AI will change what teachers do, not whether they are needed. By automating the routine and illuminating the invisible, AI can elevate the human work of teachingâ€”mentorship, inspiration, and the cultivation of character and community.

8) Many people rely heavily on smartphones and the internet for daily tasks. Is this a positive or negative trend? (Opinion essay)

Heavy reliance on smartphones and the internet has become integral to modern life. On balance, I see this as a conditionally positive trend that enhances productivity and access, provided users and policymakers manage the associated risks.

Positively, digital tools streamline tasksâ€”navigation, payments, schedulingâ€”and democratize information and services. Telemedicine, e-government, and online education reduce barriers for rural residents and people with disabilities. Smartphones also strengthen social ties through low-cost communication and enable citizen reporting in emergencies.

Yet drawbacks are significant. Continuous notifications fragment attention and reduce deep work. Algorithmic feeds can distort information diets and fuel polarization, while pervasive data collection threatens privacy and autonomy. For some, online interaction substitutes for face-to-face connection, increasing loneliness; for others, gig economy precarity blurs boundaries between work and rest.

Mitigation requires multi-layered action. Individuals can adopt digital hygiene: disabling non-essential notifications, batching messages, and using app timers and focus modes. Organizations should respect right-to-disconnect norms and design humane workflows. Governments must enforce robust data protection, algorithmic transparency, and platform accountability, while expanding digital literacy in schools and communities.

Used deliberately, smartphones and the internet amplify human capability; used passively, they can erode it. The goal is not less technology but better, more mindful use.

9) Some believe social media is causing more harm than good in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree? (Opinion essay)

Social mediaâ€™s societal impact is contested. It empowers marginalized voices, accelerates information sharing, and supports small businesses. At the same time, it facilitates misinformation, polarizes discourse, and can harm mental health. I believe the balance of outcomes hinges on governance and user practice; with the right safeguards, benefits can outweigh harms.

On the positive side, grassroots campaigns have mobilized around hashtags, and real-time updates aid crisis response. Entrepreneurs leverage low-cost marketing to reach customers, while communities form around shared interests and support needs. Diaspora networks maintain cultural ties across borders.

However, engagement-driven algorithms often privilege outrage and sensationalism, deepening echo chambers. Coordinated disinformation undermines trust in institutions. For adolescents in particular, social comparison and cyberbullying correlate with anxiety and sleep disruption. Data exploitation without meaningful consent further erodes autonomy.

Shifting incentives is vital. Platforms should implement algorithmic transparency, prioritize quality signals, and give users control over feeds. Independent auditing and interoperable standards would enhance accountability. Public policy must protect privacy and competition, while investing in media literacy so users can evaluate sources and set healthy boundaries. Individuals can curate follows, disable non-essential notifications, and schedule device-free time.

In conclusion, social media is not inherently harmful; its design and use determine outcomes. With structural reforms and intentional user behavior, social mediaâ€™s civic and economic benefits can predominate.

10) Governments should spend more money on preventive health measures than on treatment. Do you agree or disagree? (Opinion essay)

I agree that marginal public spending should tilt toward prevention rather than treatment. While acute and specialist care will always be essential, prevention averts disease, reduces costs, and improves quality of life more effectively over the long term.

Preventive measures operate at multiple levels. Primary preventionâ€”vaccination, tobacco control, clean air, and safe waterâ€”stops disease before it starts. Secondary preventionâ€”screenings for cancers, hypertension, and diabetesâ€”enables early detection and less invasive treatment. Tertiary preventionâ€”rehabilitation and chronic disease managementâ€”reduces complications and readmissions. Investments in active transport and healthy school meals further tackle upstream determinants.

Economic evidence is compelling: immunizations, smoking cessation, and hypertension control deliver high returns on investment through reduced hospitalizations and productivity gains. Moreover, prevention advances equity by targeting environmental and social risks clustered in disadvantaged communities.

That said, prevention cannot replace treatment. Ethical obligations demand high-quality care for the ill, and some interventions have delayed payoffs. Therefore, the aim is a rebalanced portfolio: strengthen primary care, embed prevention targets in provider incentives, and fund public health agencies on a sustained basis rather than crisis-to-crisis.

In sum, a prevention-first strategy is fiscally prudent and humane. It keeps people healthier, frees capacity for complex care, and builds system resilience.

11) Obesity is a growing problem. What are the causes, and what solutions can be implemented to tackle it? (Problem/Solution essay)

Obesity results from a complex interplay of biology, behavior, and environment. Calorie-dense, ultra-processed foods are cheap and ubiquitous, while sedentary work and car-dependent urban design limit daily energy expenditure. Marketing targets children, normalizing oversized portions. Socio-economic factorsâ€”stress, shift work, and limited access to safe recreationâ€”compound risk, and genetics influence susceptibility.

A comprehensive response must reshape environments, not just exhort individuals. Governments should adopt clear front-of-pack labelling, restrict junk-food advertising to children, and implement taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages to nudge consumption. Revenues can subsidize fruits and vegetables and fund healthy school meals. Urban planning should prioritize safe sidewalks, cycling networks, and access to parks, while employers encourage movement breaks and flexible schedules.

Healthcare systems need scalable, evidence-based support: multidisciplinary behavioral programs, dietitian access, and digital coaching. For severe obesity, timely access to pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery can be life-changing and cost-effective. Community initiativesâ€”cooking classes, walking groups, and peer supportâ€”reinforce habits and social connection.

Success requires sustained political commitment and coordination across sectorsâ€”health, education, transport, and agriculture. By aligning incentives and infrastructure with healthy defaults, societies can bend obesity trends while respecting individual autonomy.

12) Some people think all public transport should be free to improve public health and the environment. Do you agree or disagree? (Opinion essay)

Making public transport free is an attractive idea, promising fewer cars, cleaner air, and more physical activity from walking to stops. Yet fare abolition alone rarely delivers large ridership gains without high service quality. I therefore support targeted free fares combined with substantial service and infrastructure improvements.

Evidence suggests that frequency, reliability, coverage, and perceived safety dominate mode choice. If buses remain infrequent and overcrowded, zero fares will not persuade many drivers to switch. Moreover, eliminating fares removes a revenue stream that agencies rely on to maintain and expand service; without replacement funding, quality can deteriorate.

A smarter approach is to make transit functionally free for groups with the most to gainâ€”youth, seniors, and low-income ridersâ€”while governments backfill revenue to protect service levels. Concurrent investments in bus rapid transit, dedicated lanes, integrated ticketing, and real-time information significantly improve the user experience. Transit-oriented development that clusters housing and jobs near stations further strengthens ridership and health benefits.

In short, affordability matters, but service quality and urban form matter more. Free transit should be part of a broader strategy that makes taking the bus or train the convenient, dignified, and fast choice.

13) Some people say that parents should control their childrenâ€™s use of technology, while others believe children should be trusted to use it independently. Discuss both views and give your opinion. (Discussion essay)

Parents grapple with balancing protection and autonomy in childrenâ€™s technology use. Advocates of strong control emphasize exposure risksâ€”violent or sexual content, cyberbullying, and privacy breachesâ€”and the impact of excessive screen time on sleep and attention. For younger children in particular, device settings, content filters, and time limits can create safe boundaries and healthy routines.

Conversely, proponents of trust argue that digital competence requires guided exploration. Overly restrictive rules may provoke secrecy and limit opportunities to practice self-regulation. As children mature, negotiated norms and open dialogue foster responsibility and critical thinking. Trust, they contend, is earned through incremental independence, not granted all at once.

I support a phased approach calibrated to age and maturity. Early childhood should feature close supervision, curated content, and parent-child co-use that models healthy behavior. In middle years, introduce shared decision-making: agree on screen-free zones, privacy hygiene, and device bedtimes. Adolescents should progressively manage their own use, with parents monitoring red flags and focusing on valuesâ€”respect, consent, and balanceâ€”rather than surveillance.

Schools can reinforce digital literacyâ€”evaluating sources, recognizing manipulation, and protecting dataâ€”so that independence is underpinned by competence. Ultimately, the goal is not mere compliance but internalized judgment, enabling young people to be safe, ethical, and effective online.

14) In many countries, people are living longer. What challenges does this create, and what can be done to address them? (Problem/Solution essay)

Population aging presents intertwined challenges. Pension systems strain as the ratio of workers to retirees falls, while healthcare faces increased demand for chronic disease management and long-term care. Families bear growing caregiving responsibilities, often with gendered impacts on womenâ€™s labor-force participation. Social isolation and ageism also threaten wellbeing and productivity.

Solutions must be holistic. Gradually aligning retirement ages with life expectancy, while protecting those in physically demanding jobs, can stabilize pension finances. Promoting healthy agingâ€”preventive care, physical activity, and age-friendly environmentsâ€”reduces morbidity. Expanding home- and community-based services, caregiver allowances, and respite care supports families and delays costly institutionalization.

Labor markets should embrace flexible, age-inclusive work: phased retirement, part-time options, and lifelong learning help older adults maintain skills and income. Technologyâ€”remote monitoring, telehealth, and assistive devicesâ€”can enhance independence when deployed with privacy safeguards. Urban design that ensures accessible transport, safe sidewalks, and social spaces combats isolation.

Culturally, reframing aging as an assetâ€”experience, mentorship, and civic participationâ€”unlocks human capital. With coordinated policy and societal shifts, longer lives can be a triumph to manage, not a crisis to fear.

15) Many people today feel socially isolated even in densely populated cities. What are the causes, and how can this issue be addressed? (Problem/Solution essay)

Urban isolation stems from multiple sources: transient populations, long commutes, unaffordable housing that forces frequent moves, and built environments that prioritize cars over convivial public space. Digital substitutionâ€”interacting online rather than in personâ€”can weaken neighborhood ties, while precarious work reduces time and energy for community participation.

Addressing this requires rehumanizing urban design and strengthening local institutions. The 15-minute city modelâ€”mixed-use neighborhoods where daily needs are within a short walk or cycleâ€”creates natural encounters. Investments in parks, community centers, libraries, and safe streets provide inclusive third places. Zoning for mixed-income housing reduces segregation and churn.

Programs matter too. Small grants and easy permits for block parties, street markets, and cultural events empower residents to convene. Co-working near homes, volunteer hubs, and intergenerational projects foster connection across roles and ages. Digital platforms, when moderated and linked to real-world activities, can coordinate mutual aid without replacing face-to-face contact.

Finally, employers can support work-life balance and predictable schedules so people can join local activities. With intentional design and modest resources, cities can convert proximity into genuine community.

16) Some believe the government should fund artists, while others think this money should be spent on public services. Discuss both views and give your opinion. (Discussion essay)

Public budgets are finite, prompting debate over whether the arts deserve government funding compared with core services. Critics argue that healthcare, education, and infrastructure are urgent necessities and that the market should determine which artistic endeavors succeed. They worry about subjective grantmaking and the opportunity cost of every dollar spent.

Supporters counter that many artistic activities are public goods with broad spillovers: they enrich education, cohesion, and mental health, and they anchor creative industries that drive tourism and urban regeneration. Markets tend to underprovide such goods, particularly in disadvantaged regions or for experimental work that lacks immediate commercial appeal. Public funding diversifies voices and preserves heritage that might otherwise vanish.

I support funding the arts within a transparent, outcome-focused framework. Independent peer review, regional equity mandates, and requirements for public access (free performances, outreach in schools) ensure value. Partnerships with philanthropy and business can leverage additional resources, and rigorous evaluation can refine programs over time.

Ultimately, funding the arts complements public services rather than competes with them. A society that sustains both material wellbeing and cultural vitality is more resilient, innovative, and humane.

17) Globalization is increasing the similarity between countries. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages? (Advantage/Disadvantage essay)

Globalization has undeniably made cities look and feel more alikeâ€”chain stores, shared technologies, and convergent lifestyles. This uniformity can erode local traditions, hollow out independent businesses, and increase vulnerability to global shocks when supply chains are tightly coupled. Cultural homogenization also risks reducing linguistic and artistic diversity.

Yet the advantages are substantial. Cross-border trade and knowledge flows have lifted millions from poverty, accelerated medical and technological advances, and enabled unprecedented collaboration on research and disaster response. Standardization can improve safety and interoperabilityâ€”from aviation to digital communicationsâ€”while migration and exchange foster cosmopolitanism and mutual understanding.

We need not accept homogenization as the price of connection. Smart policy can capture the gains while protecting distinctiveness: support for local SMEs and artisans, cultural preservation funds, and urban planning that prioritizes place-making over generic malls. Diversified supply chains and fair trade standards can reduce fragility and exploitation. Education that celebrates heritage alongside global citizenship encourages confident, outward-looking identities.

On balance, globalizationâ€™s benefits outweigh its harms when societies shape it, rather than being shaped by it. The goal is plural globalizationâ€”connected, but with room for difference.

18) Crime rates are rising in many urban areas. What are the causes of this trend, and how can it be reversed? (Problem/Solution essay)

Rising urban crime often reflects converging pressures: economic shocks and inequality, disrupted schooling and youth services, proliferation of illegal firearms, and weakened trust between communities and law enforcement. Environmental factorsâ€”poor lighting, abandoned buildings, liquor outlet densityâ€”create opportunities for offending. Social media can amplify conflicts and facilitate illicit markets.

Reversing the trend requires focused, evidence-based strategies. Hot-spot policing that concentrates resources on micro-locations with high harm, combined with procedural justice to build legitimacy, can reduce violence without blanket enforcement. Focused deterrenceâ€”engaging the small number of groups driving serious crime, coupling clear consequences with tailored supportâ€”has shown durable impacts. Environmental design upgradesâ€”lighting, cleaning vacant lots, activating public spacesâ€”lower opportunistic crime.

Prevention is paramount: expand after-school programs, apprenticeships, and mental health and addiction services to address root causes and provide off-ramps. Data-sharing across agencies and community organizations enables rapid problem-solving. Gun violence reduction demands upstream controls, tracing, and disruption of trafficking networks.

Sustained progress depends on trust. Co-produced safety plans, transparent metrics, and independent oversight align police and resident priorities. With targeted enforcement and robust social investment, cities can bend crime curves while strengthening civil liberties.
